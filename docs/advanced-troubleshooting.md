# Advanced Troubleshooting
If basic steps didnâ€™t help, try the following:

- Use **DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)** to remove GPU drivers completely.
- Check **Windows Event Viewer** for system errors.
- Run **MemTest86** to test RAM stability.
- Check SSD health using **CrystalDiskInfo**.
- Run `sfc /scannow` and `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`.
- If experiencing stuttering, check **LatencyMon**.

If nothing helps, reinstalling Windows might be necessary.
